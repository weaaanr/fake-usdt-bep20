This smart contract is a **dangerous fake**, designed to imitate the behavior of the legitimate USDT on the BEP-20 standard. It is crafted to deceive users into believing it is a genuine token.

## **Contract Features**

### **Mimics Original USDT**
- **Ticker:** `USDT`
- **Standard:** BEP-20
- Visually and functionally similar to the legitimate USDT contract.

### **Key Threats**
1. **Cold wallets** (e.g., Trust Wallet, MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet) accept this token as genuine USDT. Swaps result in errors, but the balance still appears and doesnâ€™t disappear. If the user holds real USDT, the fake USDT balance gets added to it.
2. Simulates transactions using common methods like `transfer`, `approve`, `allowance`.
3. Creates false trust by replicating events and data identical to original tokens.

## **Usage Instructions**

1. **Copy the Code**
   - Copy the code from the file `TetherUSD.sol` into your project.

2. **Deploy the Contract**
   - Deploy the contract on the blockchain via [Remix Ethereum IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/).

3. **Compile the Contract**
